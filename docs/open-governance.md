# Public Review 

The luma.gl v9 API is in a "public review phase". This means that the project is setting aside
some time to make sure the community has an opportunity to react to and 
comment on the big API changes in the luma.gl v9 API. All input will be considered and may potentially
lead to design changes.

## Open Governance

luma.gl is part of the vis.gl suite which is under open governance through the Linux Foundation.
Among other things, this means that the vis.gl projects make efforts to share information about what we are doing
and that there is a path for users and contributors to influence the project.

Due to the major overhaul of luma.gl required to support and fully embrace WebGPU, 
the luma.gl v9 API contains a significant number of breaking changes which will affect the community.

While the intention to port luma.gl (and eventually the full vis.gl suite) to WebGPU
has been communicated in previous open governance meetings, it was not possible to 
predict the extent of the API changes before the work started.

## Providing Feedback

To give the community a chance to assess and respond to the API changes, 
both luma.gl v9 docs and luma.gl v9 alpha releases have been published.

During this phase, the project will accept and consider comments and 
potentially make additional changes to the API.

Comments can be submitted on the luma.gl 
[GitHub discussions board](https://github.com/visgl/luma.gl/discussions).

## Timeline

The public review phase is currently expected to end on March 31, 2022.

Shortly after the public review phase ends, an official luma.gl v9 release will be made available.
